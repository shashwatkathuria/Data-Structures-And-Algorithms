# LAZY SELECT ALGORITHM - RANDOMIZED ALGORITHM
------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------------

The following command must be executed to run the program:

      python3 lazySelect.py


------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM
------------------------------------------

The explanation of the algorithm is given in the following link :
https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27685/can-someone-explain-lazyselect

Alongwith the answer of the kth minimum element in the input array,
the various probabilities of success, one pass, median number of passes, etc.
are outputted in this algorithm. The run time complexity of this algorithm is
O(n) in the conditions specified in the link given above, where n is the number of
elements in the input file/array.
