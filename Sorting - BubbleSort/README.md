# BUBBLE SORT
------------------------------------
# INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------

The input array of a 100,000 entries is already provided in IntegerArray.txt.\n
To run the program, the following command is to be executed:\n
          python bubblesort.py


------------------------------------
# ALGORITHM
------------------------------------

In Bubble Sort algorithm, every 2 adjacent neighbouring elements of the array
are swapped if the right neighbour is smaller. This is done for elements from the
ith position uptil the end of the array (where i is the ith iteration of the for
loop of the algorithm). This linear pass is done for each i. The elements upto
the ith position are all sorted whereas the other subarray is unsorted.The best
case run time of this algorithm is O(n) whereas the worst case is O(n^2).The
algorithm can be terminated if there are no swaps in the ith iteration of the
algorithm.
